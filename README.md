This project involves creating personalized letters by merging a list of invited names into a template letter. The program reads names from a text file and inserts each name into a predefined template letter, then saves the customized letters to a specified directory.

By strategically breaking down the task into manageable steps and carefully handling file paths and operations, I effectively created a solution that reads names, customizes letters, and saves them in an organized manner. This demonstrates a strong grasp of both the problem-solving process and the technical details involved in file handling and path management in Python.
